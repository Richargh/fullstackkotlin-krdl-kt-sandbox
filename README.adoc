= React with Kotlin

*Features*:

* Kotlin Multiplatform Project
* Frontend=Kotlin, Backend=Kotlin, Shared Api=Kotlin
* Javalin
* Karate Testing

== Usage

Start with `./gradlew clean backend:run` and navigate to localhost:7000

== Kotlin Js / Fullstack

The best example I could find was the link:https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-messenger/blob/step-4-kotlin-js/frontend/build.gradle.kts[Spring Messenger] which this project is heavily based on but there exists an official link:https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-fullstack-sample/blob/master/frontend/build.gradle[fullstack example] as well. Sadly that example uses the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.frontend` plugin which link:https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/06/kotlin-1-3-40-released/[will be deprecated] in favor of the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.js` plugin once all features have been ported over. The `js` plugin is also used by the link:https://github.com/Schahen/dukatGradleDemo[Dukat Gradle demo].

== Karate

More Karate examples can be found in their link:https://intuit.github.io/karate/karate-demo/[demo project].
